# Yearly-Tracker

This is a yearly tracker designed for total-visibility, minimalism, and usability.
It allows you to keep track of high-level events of the entire year.
It offers functionalities to create monthly topics and categorize events in a per-topic fashion.
For simplicity, each month only allows up-to 4 topics, making you aware of events and force you to prioritize.
The app offers local persistent storage as well as download/upload calendar functionality.

Implementation wise, it is a simplistic web-app built with React and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
